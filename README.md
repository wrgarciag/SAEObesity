# SAE Obesity
Estimacion de prevalencias de obesidad adulta por municipio

Monitoring and control programs at local levels that address obesity growing trends are likely to be more effective than non-specific programs planned at the national level or at the regional level.  We use small area estimation techniques to monitor obesity in Colombia. We estimate obesity prevalence rates at the Municipal through SAE Models that matches obesity measured by the Body Mass Index and socio-demographic data in the Colombia National Nutrition Survey 2015 to the National Census 2018 socio-demographic municipal data.
